 * @file On-disk contribution checks for a LOADED integration.
 *
 * These validators live in foundation rather than beside the
 * `validate-integration` command because foundation itself needs them:
 * `Project` collects integration issues while assembling components/templates,
 * and `integration-warnings` nudges about them on ordinary commands. Keeping
 * them here means those callers no longer reach up into `api/`.
 *
 * The manifest schema is NOT re-validated here — `loadIntegrations` already did
 * that and throws otherwise. What is re-checked is the on-disk contributions
 * (roots + codemods/templates/components), because those regress independently
 * of the manifest: a deleted directory, a template that lost its source file.
 *
 * @input a loaded-integration-shaped object (absolute contribution roots + identity)
 * @output AstryxIntegrationIssue[]
