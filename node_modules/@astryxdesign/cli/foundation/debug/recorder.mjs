/**
 * @file The recorder — one event per invocation, handed to your function.
 *
 * The whole feature: a project sets `debug` in `astryx.config`, and that
 * function receives every command run. No configuration beyond the function
 * itself, and nothing stored anywhere.
 *
 * ## Why the handoff happens at exit
 *
 * The CLI's failure path does not unwind. `cliError()` prints and calls
 * `process.exit()` synchronously, which means a `try/finally` around a command
 * action never runs on an error, and Commander's `postAction` hooks are
 * skipped too. Anything that reported on those paths would deliver a stream of
 * successes and almost no failures — precisely inverted from what a usage
 * record is for.
 *
 * So the recorder accumulates into a single mutable event and registers one
 * `process.on('exit')` listener, which fires for a normal return AND for every
 * `process.exit()` call. Signals bypass `exit` entirely, so those are handled
 * separately below. The listener is synchronous — Node abandons pending async
 * work once `exit` is emitted — which is why a handler cannot do network I/O.
 *
 * ## Why every entry point is guarded
 *
 * Recording must never be the reason a command fails. Every exported function
 * swallows its own errors; the worst outcome of a bug in here is a missing or
 * partial event.
 *
 * @input  lifecycle calls, result summaries, and a handler from config
 * @output one event per invocation, delivered to that handler
 * @position packages/cli/foundation/debug — runtime
