/**
 * @file Public surface of the debug subsystem — the one module the CLI layer
 * imports.
 *
 * The whole feature is: capture everything about an invocation, and hand it to
 * a function the project supplied via `debug` in `astryx.config`. Nothing is
 * stored; the handler decides what happens to the data.
 *
 * The instrumentation contract is small on purpose:
 *
 *   begin()                  once, before Commander parses
 *   setCommand/setArgs/…     as facts become known
 *   recordResultSummary()    when a command returns a result set
 *   setOutcome()             from every terminal path (error, fatal, gate)
 *   finish()                 automatic, via the exit listener begin() installs
 *
 * Nothing here throws. See recorder.mjs for why every call is guarded.
 *
 * @input  lifecycle calls from the CLI layer
 * @output one event per invocation, delivered to the project's handler
 * @position packages/cli/foundation/debug — public surface
