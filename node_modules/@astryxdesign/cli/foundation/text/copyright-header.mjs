/**
 * @file Strips our repo's copyright header from files we scaffold into someone
 * else's project.
 *
 * Every file in this repo carries the Meta copyright header, and several
 * commands copy repo files out verbatim — `theme add` (bundled theme sources),
 * `init --features theme` (the annotated theme template), `template --cdn` (the
 * CDN starter page). A consumer's own source tree should not inherit our
 * boilerplate, and their lint may well reject it.
 *
 * SYNC: the same regex is applied by apps/docsite/src/lib/codeExamples.ts for
 * rendered code samples. That copy lives in a different package (the docsite
 * cannot import CLI internals), so a change to the header format has to land in
 * both.
