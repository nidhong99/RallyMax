/**
 * A component's *documented* theming vars must survive `astryx theme build`.
 *
 * `validatePrivateVars` rejects a theme that sets a `--_*` var, on the rule
 * that private vars are reached through the derived-var pipeline rather than
 * written directly. That makes "which prefix a themeable var carries" a
 * build-time contract rather than a naming preference — and nothing checked
 * the two against each other, so a component could document a var, and ship a
 * changeset telling theme authors to set it, that the build then complains
 * about (#5214).
 *
 * The theme this builds is generated FROM each component's own
 * `theming.vars[]`, not from a snippet copied into this file. A hand-copied
 * snippet only ever proves the builder accepts the string it was handed; a
 * doc-driven one fails the moment a component documents a var a theme author
 * cannot actually set. It covers every component with public vars, so the
 * next one is covered without touching this file.
 *
 * Asserted on the receipt's `warnings` rather than on a rejection: a private
 * var is reported (logged `✗`, collected into the receipt) and the build then
 * emits its CSS and resolves anyway. Asserting a throw would pass for the
 * wrong reason — it never throws, which is why a throwaway build read as a
 * pass on the first version of #5214.
 *
 * `themeBuild` compiles via @astryxdesign/core's generator, so it needs a built
 * core — the `node` project's globalSetup builds it once before workers fork.
