/**
 * @file `template.cdn` leaf — writes the annotated no-build-step starter page
 * into the consumer's project.
 *
 * A CDN starter is a template, so it lives in the template family. It is the
 * one member that is not discovered: it ships as an asset rather than as a
 * `page.tsx` + `template.doc.mjs` pair, which is why the dispatcher routes to
 * it from a flag instead of resolving a name.
 *
 * Every CDN URL in the asset carries the `__ASTRYX_VERSION__` placeholder, which
 * is substituted here. An unpinned CDN URL resolves to whatever is latest and is
 * cached hard, so a page written today can break tomorrow without being edited.
 *
 * @position api/template/cdn — writes the CDN starter asset; the template
 *   dispatcher routes `--cdn` here before any discovery happens.
