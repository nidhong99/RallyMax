/**
 * @file build.kit leaf — the grouped composition kit and raw match count.
 *
 * Runs the unified search for the query and groups the results into a
 * composition KIT: the closest page templates, the blocks that cover parts,
 * and the domain components to fill gaps, plus the always-on frame + foundation.
 *
 * The kit carries RAW `SearchResultEntry` objects and static name arrays only —
 * never pre-formatted command strings. All CLI prefixing (formatCliCommand /
 * getCliInvocation) and the section prose live in the command renderer, so the
 * JSON shape stays package-manager-agnostic and stable across environments.
