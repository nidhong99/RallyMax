 * This is a CONTRACT, not an internal detail. A project attaches a function
 * in `astryx.config` (`debug: event => {}`) and receives one of these per
 * command run. Whatever that function feeds — a warehouse table, a file, a
 * one-off script — codes against {@link DebugEvent}.
 *
 * Treat it as append-only. Add fields freely; never repurpose or remove one.
 * When an existing field changes meaning, widen {@link DebugSchemaVersion} so
 * every consumer gets a compile error at the branch points instead of quietly
 * reading a field that no longer means what it did.

 * 3. **Free text is scrubbed.** Anything the environment supplied as text
 *    (`agent`, `agentIdentity`) goes through the same content rules as argv.
 *    The rest is derived from a fixed vocabulary this CLI controls and is kept
