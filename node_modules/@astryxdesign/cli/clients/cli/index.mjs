 * Load the handlers that will receive this run, before Commander parses.

 * never touch `astryx.config` on their own, and parse errors and `--help`
 * short-circuit before any hook runs — so anywhere later would leave exactly
 * the failures you most want reported with nowhere to report them.
 *
 * The gate before the load is the point. `Project.load` EVALUATES the config
 * module and loads every integration it names, and before this feature most
 * commands did neither: running a project's own code on `astryx --version`,
 * for a project that never asked for any of this, is not a cost the feature
 * gets to impose. So the file is read as text first and only loaded if it
 * mentions something that could produce a handler. A project with no config
 * pays one `existsSync` walk; a project with a config that mentions neither
 * pays one small `readFile`.
 *
 * TWO words open the gate, because there are two places a handler can come
 * from. `debug` is the project's own. `integrations` is the other: an
 * integration contributes a handler as a `debug` named export from its
 * manifest, so a config that lists integrations may have one even though the
 * word `debug` appears nowhere in it — which is the shape of essentially every
 * app that installs an integration. Without the second word this feature would
 * reach only the commands that happen to load a Project for their own reasons
 * (`component`, `search`, `docs`, `template`, `doctor`, …) and would miss
 * `--version`, `--help`, `theme *`, `blog`, and every parse error.
 *
 * Measured cost of that second word, on an integration whose manifest is
 * TypeScript (the expensive case — jiti): ~50ms added to `astryx --version`,
 * and nothing at all to a command that was going to load the project anyway.
 * It is paid only by projects that declare integrations.
 *
 * The text test is deliberately loose — any occurrence, comments included —
 * because a false positive costs one config load the CLI used to do anyway,
 * while a false negative silently records nothing. The one shape it cannot
 * see is a config that never spells either word, e.g. spreading in an object
 * from another module; that is documented on the `debug` config key.
