# FieldStatus component contract

## Intent

FieldStatus presents one validation message for a field or field-like control. It
owns the visible message treatment and announcement behavior for attached and
detached presentations; consumer usage remains documented in
`FieldStatus.doc.mjs`.

## Compatibility and migration

- Released default preserved: `yes`
- Compatibility class: additive documentation only; runtime, DOM, styling, and
  public API remain unchanged
- Controlled/uncontrolled behavior: not applicable
- Migration decision: direct `FieldStatus variant="tooltip"` support is rejected.
  `tooltip` remains a field-family sentinel that MUST be handled before rendering
  FieldStatus. Narrowing the currently permissive type/runtime path requires a
  separate compatibility-aware implementation change.

Consumer migration instructions belong in consumer docs and release notes.

## Ownership boundary

**Owns**

- The attached and detached validation-message presentations.
- Routing visible messages through the persistent announcement channels.
- The detached presentation's redundant visual status glyph.

**Does not own / non-goals**

- Whether a caller renders a status message, or which control it describes —
  owned by the composing field component or product callsite.
- The bordered control's status treatment and on-field tooltip presentation —
  owned by the composing field component.
- General alerts and page-level notices — owned by the corresponding feedback
  components.

## Public concepts

| Concept      | Closed values or states       | Meaning                                            | Availability by variant/orientation/state                                                                  | Default    | Owner                   | Stability | Invalid-value behavior                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Status type  | `error`, `warning`, `success` | Selects the message tone and announcement channel. | All rendered presentations.                                                                                | Required   | `component:FieldStatus` | Stable    | TypeScript rejects unsupported values.                                                                                          |
| Presentation | `attached`, `detached`        | Selects the message presentation.                  | All direct FieldStatus usage. The field family's `tooltip` sentinel is handled before FieldStatus renders. | `attached` | `component:FieldStatus` | Stable.   | TypeScript rejects values absent from the extensible variant map; its current acceptance of `tooltip` is an implementation gap. |

The field family's `tooltip` status presentation suppresses FieldStatus and
surfaces the message from the control's on-field icon. `tooltip` is not a
FieldStatus presentation. The public extensible variant map currently permits a
direct `tooltip` value; that is an implementation gap, not supported behavior.

## Behavioral and layout contract

Draft requirements identify their basis so observed code is not mistaken for an
intentional decision.

| ID  | Candidate invariant                                                                                                                                        | Basis                                               | Draft review state                                      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| FR1 | FieldStatus MUST render the provided message in one visible message box when mounted.                                                                      | Documented promise and current tests.               | Settled intent.                                         |
| FR2 | The attached presentation MUST render the message without a leading glyph; the detached presentation MUST render its status glyph before the message text. | Documented promise, current DOM, and current tests. | Settled intent.                                         |
| FR3 | Status type MUST select distinct error, warning, or success treatment and MUST be reflected on the message-box target.                                     | Current behavior and theming tests.                 | Settled intent.                                         |
| FR4 | The detached glyph MUST reflect status type on its own target; the target MUST be absent from attached presentation.                                       | Current behavior and target tests.                  | Settled intent.                                         |
| FR5 | The root MUST continue to forward its ref, ID, supported DOM props, and consumer styling escape hatches.                                                   | Current behavior and tests.                         | Current compatibility behavior; verify before changing. |
| FR6 | Message and status-type updates MUST update the visible output without replacing the component contract.                                                   | Current behavior and tests.                         | Current compatibility behavior; verify before changing. |
| FR7 | Direct FieldStatus usage MUST support only `attached` and `detached`; the Field family MUST consume its `tooltip` sentinel before rendering FieldStatus.   | Approved component boundary.                        | Settled intent; current type acceptance is a gap.       |

### Allowed variation

- **AV1 — Theme styling.** Theme and consumer overrides may change visual CSS
  properties through the existing targets and styling escape hatches without
  changing anatomy, ownership, or presentation behavior.
- **AV2 — Message length.** The message may wrap; the detached glyph remains
  aligned with the first text line.

### Representative states

| State            | Required invariant                                             | Allowed variation                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attached error   | Message box and text render; no detached glyph renders.        | Theme-controlled visual properties on `field-status`.       |
| Detached warning | Message box, leading warning glyph, then message text render.  | Theme-controlled visual properties on both current targets. |
| Detached success | Message box, leading success glyph, then message text render.  | Message length and theme-controlled visual properties.      |
| Empty message    | The root remains mounted and renders the provided empty value. | No announcement channel is created.                         |

### Transformation and precedence order

- **ORD1 — Presentation styling.** Resolve the default presentation, reflect
  status and presentation through `themeProps`, apply component styles, then
  merge `xstyle`, `className`, and inline `style` in their established order.
- **ORD2 — Detached content.** Render the decorative status glyph before the
  message text, using the same status-to-glyph mapping as field controls.

### Performance and resources

- **PR1 — Announcement work.** A message change schedules only the persistent
  live-region announcement; FieldStatus owns no global event listeners,
  observers, or measurements.

## Accessibility contract

- **AR1 — Announcement channel.** Errors MUST announce through the persistent
  assertive region; warnings and successes MUST announce through the persistent
  polite region, including on first mount and when message or type changes.
- **AR2 — Visible description.** The rendered message box MUST remain available
  to assistive technology for `aria-describedby` association and MUST NOT become
  its own newly mounted live region.
- **AR3 — Non-color cue.** Detached status MUST include a leading status glyph so
  status is not conveyed only by color or position.
- **AR4 — Redundant glyph.** The detached glyph MUST remain hidden from assistive
  technology because the visible message already conveys and announces the
  status.

## Design relationships

| Anatomy or state | Design requirement                                         | Representation authority                        | Hierarchy role | Component contract |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Message box      | Carries the visible validation treatment.                  | Current behavior and approved component intent. | Supporting     | FR1, FR3           |
| Detached icon    | Adds a non-color status cue only in detached presentation. | Current behavior and approved component intent. | Supporting     | FR2, FR4, AR3      |
| Message text     | Communicates the validation result in words.               | Current behavior and approved component intent. | Prominent      | FR1, AR1, AR2      |

Current behavior renders the detached icon before message text. The intended
public theming ownership is the exact map below; it does not add a target or
change either presentation.

### Theming anatomy

<!-- anatomy-theming:v1 -->

```json
{
  "Message box": {"target": "field-status"},
  "Detached icon": {"target": "field-status-icon"},
  "Message text": {"inherits": "field-status"}
}
```

## Family and system relationships

- `architecture:component-theming-surface` owns the qualification and validation
  rules for the two targets and inherited message text.
- Field-like controls compose FieldStatus but continue to own control rendering,
  status placement decisions, and association with the control.

## Decision log

### DEC-1 — Presentation-specific anatomy remains explicit

**Reference:** `component:FieldStatus/DEC-1`
**Decider:** cixzhang, 2026-08-30

The detached icon is a separate anatomy part because only detached presentation
renders it and it owns a target distinct from the message box. Message text
inherits the message-box target rather than creating a redundant child target.

Rejected: collapsing the glyph into a generic message row, which would hide its
presentation condition and distinct theming owner.

### DEC-2 — `tooltip` is not a FieldStatus presentation

**Reference:** `component:FieldStatus/DEC-2`
**Decider:** cixzhang, 2026-08-30

Direct FieldStatus usage supports only `attached` and `detached`. The Field
family may use `tooltip` as an internal presentation sentinel, but it MUST
consume that value before rendering FieldStatus and surface the message through
the control's on-field status treatment instead.

Rejected: defining direct `FieldStatus variant="tooltip"` rendering semantics.
That would expose a field-composition mechanism as a third FieldStatus
presentation and preserve currently unintentional output.
